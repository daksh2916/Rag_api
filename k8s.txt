Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications. Originally developed by Google, it acts as a container orchestrator, organizing containers into pods to facilitate self-healing, service discovery, and load balancing across clusters. It is widely used in cloud-native development to manage complex application lifecycles across public, private, or hybrid clouds.
